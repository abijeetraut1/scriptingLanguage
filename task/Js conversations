Introduction to JavaScript:

JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for building dynamic web pages. It enables interaction with users, enhances website interactivity, and facilitates the development of web applications. JavaScript is commonly employed alongside HTML and CSS to create responsive and engaging user interfaces.

JavaScript Coding Conventions:

1. Indentation:
   Use spaces (typically 2 or 4) for code indentation to enhance readability.

2. Variable Naming:
   Choose meaningful and descriptive variable names using camelCase (e.g., `myVariable`).

3. Semicolons:
   Although optional in some cases, it's recommended to use semicolons to end statements.

4. Comments:
   Comment your code to explain complex sections or provide context. Use `//` for single-line comments and `/* */` for multiline comments.

5. Function Declaration:
   Declare functions using the `function` keyword followed by the function name and parameters.

6. Console Logging:
   Use `console.log()` for debugging and logging information to the console.
