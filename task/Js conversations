console.log("Hello, World!");



1. Indentation:
   When you're typing away, make sure to give your code some space. Use a couple of spaces (or more) to keep things neat and readable.

2. Variable Naming:
   Think of variables like nicknames for your data. Choose names that make sense and stick to camelCase. Like, `myVariable` instead of `this_is_my_variable`.

3. Semicolons:
   Throw in a semicolon at the end of your statements. It's like putting a period at the end of a sentence. It just feels right.

4. Comments:
   Don't be shy – leave notes for yourself or others in your code. Use `//` for short comments and `/* */` for the longer stories.

5. Function Declaration:
   Functions are like little helpers in your code. Declare them with the `function` keyword, give them a name, and let them do their thing.

6. Console Logging:
   Need to know what's happening behind the scenes? `console.log()` is your friend. It's like your code's personal diary – it tells you what's going on.
